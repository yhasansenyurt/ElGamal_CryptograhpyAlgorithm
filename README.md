# ElGamal_CryptograhpyAlgorithm
ECB and CBC Ciphering Modes of ElGamal Algorithm.

Project was made by me and my collegue @marcocampione, both students of the Warsaw University of Technology (Politechnika Warszawska) during our student exchange period.

This project concerns the ElGamal cipher. ElGamal cryptosystem can be defined as the cryptography algorithm that uses the public and private key concepts to secure communication between two systems. It can be considered the asymmetric algorithm where the encryption and decryption happen by using public and private keys. In order to encrypt the message, the public key is used by the client, while the message could be decrypted using the private key on the server end. This is considered an efficient algorithm to perform encryption and decryption as the keys are extremely tough to predict.
